This project presents a machine learning-based loan prediction system aimed at improving the accuracy of identifying qualified loan applicants. The system is built using multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA and boosting techniques like Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, XGBoost,  AdaBoost. After preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and balancing classes, the models were trained and evaluated on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Ensemble techniques were implemented using the top-performing models to further enhance prediction reliability. A responsive web interface, built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, provides an intuitive platform for users to submit details and receive instant predictions. Designed with responsive principles, the interface maintains optimal functionality across all device types, while interactive components including real-time form validation and smooth UI transitions enhance the user experience. The resulting system provides a scalable, data-driven solution to support financial institutions in assessing loan applications efficiently and accurately.
